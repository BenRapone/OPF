\paragraph{Notation:}
We denote vectors by bold lowercase letters, e.g., $\vx, \vu \in \R^n$, and matrices by upper case letters, e.g., $A \in \R^{m \times n}$.
The vectors of all zeros and all ones are denoted $\vzero$ and $\vone$, respectively.
Individual entries in a vector $\vx$ are denoted $x_i$, for instance.
We let $[n]$ denote the numbers $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$.
