\section{Discussion} \label{sec:disc}

In this paper we have proposed novel and efficient techniques for determining robust solvability of quadratic systems with uncertainty. 
It is worth mentioning that the same machinery can be used to determine robustness margins of solutions to static systems by taking $A$ to be the identity, $e_i=0 \ \forall i$ and simply adjusting $\bold b$ accordingly. 
The models presented here are in some sense just the tip of the iceberg. 
More efficient models can certainly be derived using the theory contained here. 
We present these models only as examples of how efficient algorithms could be constructed utilizing the theoretical results we presented.
