\delete{Need to add mode details...}

We have proposed novel and efficient techniques for determining robust solvability of quadratic systems with uncertainty. 
It is worth mentioning that the same machinery can be used to determine robustness margins of solutions to static systems by taking $A$ to be the identity, $e_i=0 \ \forall i$ and simply adjusting $\vb$ accordingly.  
More efficient models can certainly be derived using the theory contained here. 
We present these models only as examples of how efficient algorithms could be constructed utilizing the theoretical results we presented.
