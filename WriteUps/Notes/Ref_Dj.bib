abstract = { We propose a new robust optimization method for problems with objective functions that may be computed via numerical simulations and incorporate constraints that need to be feasible under perturbations. The proposed method iteratively moves along descent directions for the robust problem with nonconvex constraints and terminates at a robust local minimum. We generalize the algorithm further to model parameter uncertainties. We demonstrate the practicability of the method in a test application on a nonconvex problem with a polynomial cost function as well as in a real-world application to the optimization problem of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for cancer treatment. The method significantly improves the robustness for both designs. }

abstract="Optimal power flow (OPF) is the central optimization problem in electric power grids. Although solved routinely in the course of power grid operations, it is known to be strongly NP-hard in general, and weakly NP-hard over tree networks. In this paper, we formulate the optimal power flow problem over tree networks as an inference problem over a tree-structured graphical model where the nodal variables are low-dimensional vectors. We adapt the standard dynamic programming algorithm for inference over a tree-structured graphical model to the OPF problem. Combining this with an interval discretization of the nodal variables, we develop an approximation algorithm for the OPF problem. Further, we use techniques from constraint programming (CP) to perform interval computations and adaptive bound propagation to obtain practically efficient algorithms. Compared to previous algorithms that solve OPF with optimality guarantees using convex relaxations, our approach is able to work for arbitrary tree-structured distribution networks and handle mixed-integer optimization problems. Further, it can be implemented in a distributed message-passing fashion that is scalable and is suitable for ``smart grid'' applications like control of distributed energy resources. Numerical evaluations on several benchmark networks show that practical OPF problems can be solved effectively using this approach.",

abstract = "Abstract Higher penetration of renewable energy sources and market liberalization increase both the need for transmission capacity and the uncertainty in power system operation. New methods for power system operational planning are needed to allow for efficient use of the grid, while maintaining security against disturbances. In this paper, we propose a risk model for risks related to outages, accounting for available remedial measures and the impact of cascading events. The new risk model is used to formulate risk-based constraints for the post-contingency line flows, which are included in an optimal power flow (OPF) formulation. Forecast uncertainty is accounted for by formulating the relevant constraints as a joint chance constraint, and the problem is solved using a sampling-based technique. In a case study of the \{IEEE\} 30 bus system, we demonstrate how the proposed risk-based, probabilistic \{OPF\} allows us to control the risk level, even in presence of uncertainty. We investigate the trade-off between generation cost and risk level in the system, and show how accounting for uncertainty leads to a more expensive, but more secure dispatch. "
